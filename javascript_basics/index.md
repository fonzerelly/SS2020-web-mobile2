* There are even microcontrollers that run javacript 
And it is so easy to lern, that even without much programming experience you can achieve very fast  good results.

## BUT...
??NOTE
But all of its power has not been achieved without flaws. And we will now  examine some of those flaws that makes many professional software developers say, that JavaScript is bullshit. But most of this course will prefer the view, that JavaScript is a good thing.

== is not the same as ===
??NOTE
Flaws in a Programming language are things that make the reading of a programming language unintitive.

When you apply == in Java to two variables and those variables carry only basic datatypes like integers or boolean, then you can be sure, that this operation returns true if those values are equal and false if they are not.
