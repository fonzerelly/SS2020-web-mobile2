??Note
Welcome to the Seminar of Web Mobile 2. My name is Christian Hörauf, and I have been working the IT-Industry for 16 years now. 7 of them I spend in the Web-Business as Frontend Developer. Currently I work for Consorsbank in Nürnberg. I spend lots of time with AngularJS but also with Angular and other JavaScript technologies.

## Goals of the seminar
* Focus Frontend Technologies <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Simulation of the job "Programmer"  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Learn methods and tools of SoftwareDevelopment <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Software Craftspeople: What is good and bad Software? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

??NOTE
First of all, we will concentrate in this course on Frontend technologies that help to create a good user experience. There are several programming languages that help you on this issue, but we will see, that JavaScript plays a very important role here.
The second goal I try to hit is to give you an idea about how it feels like to be a programmer. I want you to see not only how demanding such a job is, but also how interesting and funny it can be. And even if you will not write code yourself in your job and become more of a Project Manager or Product Owner, it is good that you get a gut feeling of what a Software Developer can do and what she / he can't do. 
For that you ought to learn some of the methods and tools that are important to get a Software Project going. So we will have a short view on Scrum and several quality measures and tools you will find in the industry.
Finally I have to confess, that I am a member of the Software Craftspeople community and I hope to give an impression about what is good and bad software.

To find the proper groups, we will do now some small exercises. Please first line up by age. If you do not know each other, please use this exercise to get to know each other a little bit.

## Teambuilding II
Asuming, the room mirrors the area of germany, please position yourself where you come from in reality.

## Teambuilding III
Lineup in a row sorted by your experience in computer science. How many lines of code have you written roughly?

??NOTE
We know there will be about 30 participants. Split the line after 18
people, so that 2 good programmers come up 3 medicore programmers.
