??Note
Welcome to the Seminar of Web-Engineering. My name is Christian Hörauf, and I have been working the IT-Industry for 16 years now. 7 of them I spend in the Web-Business as Frontend Developer. Currently I work for Consorsbank in Nürnberg.

## Goals of the seminar
* Focus Frontend Technologies <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Simulation of the job "Programmer"  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Learn methods and tools of SoftwareDevelopment <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Software Craftspeople: What is good and bad Software? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

??NOTE
First of all, we will concentrate in this course on Frontend technologies that help to create a good user experience. There are several programming languages that help you on this issue, but we will see, that JavaScript plays a very important role here.
The second goal I try to hit is to give you an idea about how it feels like to be a programmer. I want you to see not only how demanding such a job is, but also how interesting and funny it can be. And even if you will not write code yourself in your job and become more of a Project Manager or Product Owner, it is good that you get a gut feeling of what a Software Developer can do and what she / he can't do. 
For that you ought to learn some of the methods and tools that are important to get a Software Project going. So we will have a short view on Scrum and several quality measures and tools you will find in the industry.
Finally I have to confess, that I am a member of the Software Craftspeople community and I hope to give an impression about what is good and bad software.

## First things first
How will you be graded?
* Presentation 20% <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Software Project <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Realization and presentation of the Project 40% <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Development process 40% <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

??NOTE
I know, I know, you are very interested in the topic itself. But somehow you need a grade for this course. So the good message is, there won't be Test for this course. But I have several bad news for you. You will do a presentation about a web framework, which will take 20% of the end result. In addition we will create a Software project together. This will be some kind of simple Frontend only game or if you come up with an interesting idea, I would like to support you in realizing it. But the Project itself and how you present it will only be rated with 40% of the complete grade. The missing 40% I will spend on the way you will implement the project. So what quality measures do you take, how fast can you deploy a new version and similar aspects, that we will discuss on the second seminar day.

??NOTE
Besides the 5 Course-Days we will have this year, we will have another one in January. Since we do not yet exactly know, when your Tests will we be, we will have to figure out the last dates, when you know your Test appointments. (around november)
In addition, you will work on the software projects in groups of 4-5 students. I will act as Product Owner (I will explain later what that is) of your projects, so that I can take into account that your time is limited. To do so, each group will have a video chat with me for about 30 minutes every two weeks. -->Define Group Chat dates upfront

## Teambuilding I
Line up in a row sorted by age.

??NOTE
To find the proper groups, we will do now some small exercises. Please first line up by age. If you do not know each other, please use this exercise to get to know each other a little bit.

## Teambuilding II
Asuming, the room mirrors the area of germany, please position yourself where you come from in reality.

??NOTE

## Teambuilding III
Lineup in a row sorted by your experience in computer science. How many lines of code have you written roughly?

??NOTE
We know there will be about 21 participants. Split the line after 8
people, so that 2 good programmers come up 3 medicore programmers.
